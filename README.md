# SimpleDht
Chord like DHT table for Android Platform

This is a simple DHT based on Chord. Although the design is based on Chord, it is a simplified version of Chord.
The three things which have been implemented are: 
1) ID space partitioning/re-partitioning, 
2) Ring-based routing, and 
3) Node joins.
